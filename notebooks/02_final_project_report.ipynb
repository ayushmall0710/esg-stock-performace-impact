        "## Abstract\n",
        "This study evaluates whether stronger Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profiles for S&P 500 firms during September 2023–August 2024 are associated with superior risk-adjusted performance and lower risk. Using ESG scores from Sustainalytics (via Kaggle/Yahoo Finance), daily stock prices, and FRED risk-free rates, we construct a firm-level analysis dataset of 419 companies and estimate cross-sectional OLS models of Sharpe ratio and volatility, controlling for firm size and sector effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings**\n",
        "- **RQ1 (Risk-Adjusted Returns):** No statistically significant relationship between ESG scores and Sharpe ratios (coef = -0.0043, p = 0.535, R² = 0.204).\n",
        "- **RQ2 (Volatility):** Higher ESG scores are associated with slightly **higher** volatility (coef = +0.0016, p = 0.018, R² = 0.149), contrary to de-risking claims.\n",
        "- **RQ3 (Pillars):** Governance is the only significant pillar driving the volatility relationship (+0.0063, p = 0.013); Environmental and Social pillars show no significant effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "ESG scores alone do not deliver near-term risk-adjusted performance premia in this window and may correlate with marginally higher risk, underscoring the need for deeper factor controls, longer horizons, and transparent evaluation of ESG investment claims.\n"

        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "### 1.1 Motivation\n",
        "ESG investing is expected to exceed $53T by 2025 (Bloomberg Intelligence, 2021). Asset managers often market ESG as delivering both impact and superior returns, yet empirical evidence is mixed and sometimes opaque. This project provides a transparent, reproducible test of those claims for S&P 500 firms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Research Objectives\n",
        "1. Test whether higher ESG scores relate to superior risk-adjusted returns.  \n",
        "2. Test whether higher ESG scores reduce stock return volatility.  \n",
        "3. Identify which ESG pillar (E, S, G) drives any observed effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Scope\n",
        "- Universe: S&P 500 constituents (as of Sept 2023)\n",
        "- Window: Sept 2023 – Aug 2024 (~12 months)\n",
        "- Design: Cross-sectional firm-level regressions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 Why This Matters\n",
        "- **Investors:** Need evidence on risk/return claims.  \n",
        "- **Companies:** Need realistic expectations about ESG impacts on stock performance.  \n",
        "- **Researchers/Policymakers:** Benefit from transparent, reproducible pipelines and documented limitations.\n"

        "- **Meta-analyses:** NYU Stern & Rockefeller (2021) reviewed 1,000+ studies; ~58% positive, 13% negative, 29% mixed/neutral ESG–performance findings.\n",
        "- **Rating disagreement:** CFA Institute highlights large divergences across ESG vendors (e.g., Sustainalytics, MSCI, Refinitiv).\n",
        "- **Data quality:** ESG scores rely on self-reported corporate data; methodology differences drive variance.\n",
        "- **Contribution here:** Recent window (2023–24), full reproducibility, risk-adjusted focus (Sharpe), and pillar decomposition (E, S, G).\n"

        "In this S&P 500 sample, higher ESG scores did **not** improve risk-adjusted returns and were associated with slightly higher volatility, with governance as the only pillar showing a significant relationship (higher governance → modestly higher volatility). ESG appears financially neutral-to-slightly-risk-adding over this short window; investors should combine ESG with broader risk controls and test across periods. Future work should extend horizons, compare ESG providers, and incorporate richer factor controls.\n"
